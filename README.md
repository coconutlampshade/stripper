Purpose: The app is designed to strip or extract content from Boing Boing blog posts.

Functionality:
It provides a text input field where users can enter a Boing Boing permalink (a unique URL for a specific blog post on boingboing.net).
There's a button labeled "Strip Content" that users can click after entering the permalink.

Process:
When a user enters a Boing Boing permalink and clicks the "Strip Content" button, the app likely fetches the content from that specific blog post.
It then probably processes the fetched webpage, removing extraneous elements like headers, footers, sidebars, and advertisements.
The result would be the core content of the blog post, stripped of any additional webpage elements.

Use case:
This tool could be useful for readers who want to view just the main content of a Boing Boing article without the surrounding website elements.
It might be helpful for saving content, improving readability, or extracting text for other purposes.
